## 📌 Problem Statement

A company has **1,470 employees**. Every few months, some employees resign — and the company doesn't know why or who will leave next. Each resignation costs the company lakhs in hiring and training.

**Goal →** Use data science to find **why** employees are leaving and **predict** who will leave next.

## 🔍 Key Findings

| # | Finding |
|---|---|
| 1 | Employees who work **overtime** leave nearly 2x more |
| 2 | **Low salary** (Rs. 2,500–5,000) is the #1 financial driver |
| 3 | **Age group 28–35** has the highest attrition count |
| 4 | **Sales department** has disproportionately high attrition |
| 5 | Employees with **no promotion in 2+ years** are high risk |
| 6 | **Work-life balance score 3** has the most resignations |

## 📋 Prevention Recommendations

Based on data analysis, six HR interventions were identified —

1. **Overtime Management Policy** — Limit overtime, introduce compensatory off
2. **Salary Review** — Benchmark and revise salaries for low-income employees
3. **Young Talent Retention Program** — Mentorship and fast-track career paths
4. **Promotion & Recognition Cycles** — Review every 12-18 months
5. **Work-Life Balance Initiatives** — Flexible hours, hybrid work options
6. **Predictive Alert System** — Use ML model to flag at-risk employees monthly
